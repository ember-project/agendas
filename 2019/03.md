## Dates and locations of future meetings
TBD

Note: This agenda setup is similar to the [agendas for TC39 ](https://github.com/tc39/agendas)- the steering committee agreed that it would be appropriate to try out a similar setup since a core teams all-hands meeting will have a lot more attendees than core framework team meetings have in the past.
